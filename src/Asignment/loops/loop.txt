  1) what types of loops Does java support ?
     java supports 4 types of loops 

    1 -- for loop--
    it is used to iterate when the condition types in known
    it contain 3 parts 
        1--> initialization;
        2-->condition;
        3-->incrment/decrment;
    syntax
     for(data type initialization;condition;decr/incr){
         statement
		}

   2--  while loop
  it is most commanly used loop in java
	 it used when the condition is unknown(or data is fetched from the database)
	it contain 3 parts 
        1--> initialization;
        2-->condition;
        3-->incrment/decrment;
 	 
		syntax
		initilization;
		while(Condition){
		 Statement;
		incrment/decrment;
		}
     why is is most used-->  in while loop it first check the condition before go to execution

    3 --- do-while loop
	it is rarly used loop in java
    it is test the condition  when the first iteration completed
  	it contain 3 parts 
        1--> initialization;
        2-->condition;
        3-->incrment/decrment;



   Syntax  ;
    initilization;
     do{
      Statement;
     incrment/decrment;
	}
      while(Condition);


     4 ----  for each loop   --or--- enhancemnet for loop

     it is second most used loop  in java
	   in this loop there is no initilization statement;
         it used when the array iteration 
      
  	syntax
    for(  data type element  :    array name){
      statement(element);
		} 
		 
		 it is relesed j2se 5.0 version;
		  Advantages
		    1-> less code;
			2->  elements the posibality of error;
			
			
			
			
		what happen when we forget to use break statemen in switch case  ?
            if we forget to use a break in switch statement it start execution  when the condition is true but i ends at the 
					default  or  last case.
